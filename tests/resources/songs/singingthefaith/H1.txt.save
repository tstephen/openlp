
1   All people that on earth do dwell,
    sing to the Lord with cheerful voice:
    him serve with mirth, his praise forth tell;
    come ye before him and rejoice.

2   The Lord, ye know, is God indeed;
    without our aid he did us make:
    we are his folk, he doth us feed;
    and for his sheep he doth us take.

3   O enter then his gates with praise;
    approach with joy his courts unto;
    praise, laud, and bless his name always,
    for it is seemly so to do.

4   For why, the Lord our God is good;
    his mercy is for ever sure;
    his truth at all times firmly stood,
    and shall from age to age endure.

5   To Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
    the God whom heaven and earth adore,
    from earth and from the angel host
    be praise and glory evermore.


John Newton (d. 1807)
