This module contains tests for the CCLI SongSelect importer.
It needs re-writing at some point to load real HTML pages from disk and
then test the behaviour based on those. That way if and when CCLI change
their page layout, changing the tests would just be a case of
re-downloading the HTML pages and changing the code to use the new layout.
